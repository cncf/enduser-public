# CNCF End User Community

CNCF offers multiple opportunities for **End Users** to contribute and have
their voices heard. Companies that use cloud-native technologies internally, but
do not sell any cloud-native services externally, are eligible to join the End
User Community.

The community collaborates via:
* [The cncf/enduser private repo, including SIGs](https://github.com/cncf/enduser)
   * This repo includes an insightful question/answer catalog for end user companies
     that includes relatively detailed answers from end user companies about how they
     operate, what cloud native tools they're using, technical/process concerns and
     choices, etc.
* [The mailing list](https://lists.cncf.io/g/cncf-enduser/topics)
* [#enduser channel on the CNCF Slack](https://slack.cncf.io/)

If your organization is already a member of the [End User Community](https://www.cncf.io/people/end-user-community/), you can [request access here](http://memberdesk.cncf.io/) or email twaggoner@linuxfoundation.org.

## CNCF End User Partner Summit

This is the face-to-face meeting, as a Day Zero Co-located event at KubeCon CloudNativeCon. The goals are to:

* Share and learn about other end users
* Find common needs and plan future collaboration 

Tickets cost USD $100 which is donated to the diversity scholarship. Your organization must be a member of the CNCF End User Community (https://www.cncf.io/people/end-user-community/) to attend. End user members may purchase up to 4 tickets, and end user supporters may purchase up to 2.

To join, register your KubeCon CloudNativeCon ticket with your company email address and add the "CNCF End User Partner Summit" to your ticket.

The complete agenda is [available on the private cncf/enduser repository](https://github.com/cncf/enduser/blob/master/kubecon/README.md).
