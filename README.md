# CNCF End User Community

The CNCF end user community is a vendor-neutral group using cloud native technologies to build their products and services.

These experienced practitioners help power CNCF’s end user-driven open source ecosystem, steering production experience and accelerating cloud native project growth.

End users are organizations that use cloud native technologies internally and do not sell any cloud native services externally.

> The CNCF End User community excludes vendors, consultancies, training partners,and telcos at this time.
